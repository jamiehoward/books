## Author: Jeff Sutherland

## Notes

- Nine chapters. Written in 2014

1. The way the world works is broken
    - The "waterfall method" leads to many inefficiencies, like the failure to stop 9/11 attack (4)
    - Gantt chart is the long term planning with weekly breakdowns, etc. (5)
    - Scrum is the _only_ proven way to help monolithic projects (7)
    - Scrum embraces uncertainty and creativity with regards to timelines and solutions (9)
    - Scrum isn't just applicable to business (21)
    - Planning is useful. Blindly following plans is stupid (22)
    - Review regularly and change as needed (22)
    - Clinging to the way that things were previously done breeds death (22)
    - Failing as quickly as possible means learning as quickly as possible (22)
2. The origins of scrum
    - In the air force, they are taught "Observe, Orient, Decide and Act" (OODA) (24)
    - W. Edwards Deming worked for MacArthur and went on to revolutionize the Japanese manufacturing (34)
    - Deming's cycle: Plan, Do, Check Act. Acting is the modification of the plan after checking. (35-36)
    - Shu Ha Ri is the Japanese cycle of learning from mere obedience to total mastery (38)
3. Teams
    - According to Takeuchi and Nonaka, the best teams are transcendent, autonomous, and cross-functional (44)
    - Changing the team's overall performance has much more impact than individual performance (70)
    - Teams have to have a guiding purposeâ€”an overarching "why" (70)
    - Respecting the team's ability to decide and do the work enables them to succeed faster (70)
    - If the team doesn't have all of the skills necessary to complete the job, then they're going to be held up (70)
    - The rule of thumb for team size is smaller the better: +/- 7 people (70)
    - Never look for bad people. Look for bad systems (70)
4. Time
    - Work should be broken into time blocks that can be completed regularly. Sprints are 1 to 4 weeks (84)
    - Every sprint should result in work that can be shown in a demo (84)
    - Titles aren't good for internal work. We are either team members or we're not (84)
    - "Communication saturation" accelerates work. Ignorance is waste (84)
    - Do a daily stand up. This is more like a football team than an accountability group. Should only be 15 minutes or less or you're doing it wrong (84)
5. Waste is a crime
    - Multitasking is a myth and does not make you faster (109)
    - MVP doesn't mean half-done. Anything half done isn't done (109)
    - Mistakes that are fixed immediately are cheaper and quicker than when they are put off (109)
6. Plan reality, not fantasy
    - Your plan is almost certainly wrong (143)
    - Plan only enough to keep your team busy (143)
    - Humans are really bad at estimating time. Use "dogs" or points instead (143)
    - Velocity is how much work a team can get done during a sprint. (144)
    - Velocity * Time = Delivery (144)
    - Scrum allows the setting of audacious goals. (144)
7. Happiness
    - Quantify happiness and compare it to actual performance (169)
    - The sprint should have a single improvement to be done (a Kaizen) (169)
    - Nothing should be secret. The work and the purpose should be visible to anyone that wants to know. (169)
    - Complacency is the enemy of success. A little success isn't the finish line (169)
8. Priorities
    - The backlog is a prioritized list of everything that a project could have (201)
    - The product owner translates the vision of the product into the backlog. (201)
    - The product owner specifies the "what" and "why". The team determines the "how" (201)
9. Change the world
    - Eduscrum uses scrum in classrooms in the Netherlands. (205-206)
    - Muhammad Yunus's Grameen Foundation uses Scrum in Uganda with loan recipients (211)
    - Scrum can be used in any context (231)
10. Appendix
    - Steps to implement Scrum
        1. Pick a product owner
        2. Pick a team
        3. Pick a Scrum master
        4. Create and prioritize a product backlog
        5. Refine and estimate the backlog
        6. Plan the sprints
        7. Make the work visible with a board or some other tool
        8. Implement daily stand ups
        9. After the sprint, have the demos and reviews
        10. Plan a sprint retrospective, picking one "kaizen" to work on next sprint
        11. Immediately start the next sprint

## Analysis
1. "What is the book about as a whole?"
    - Scrum is the best way to do project work as a team.
2. "What is being said in detail, and how?"
    - Scrum can work for any team in any context
    - Scrum is simple enough to be implemented quickly by an inexperienced team
    - Scrum is the quickest and most efficient way to tackle any project
3. "Is the book true, in whole or part?"
    - I have certainly heard that Scrum has been used in the software and other industries to enable teams to work more quickly and efficiently, but since I have not experienced it myself, I cannot say whether its assertions are true. It's a logical approach that I will have to try out and learn as I go.
4. "What of it?"
    - I am going to implement some of this strategy at work and see how it works on a team that has varying degrees of skill sets and capabilities.
