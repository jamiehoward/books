# Book notes and reviews

## Purpose

I like to read. A lot. Even though I don't finish them all, I probably am actively reading five or more books at any given point. In the past few years, I have tried to be much more intentional with my book reading: setting goals, taking notes, and reflecting on them. For this purpose, I wanted to put together a collection of book notes and reviews that are more in-depth than the small blurbs that I typically post on [my Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40493488-jamie-howard).

## Strategy

I've had many conflicting thoughts about _how_ to go about reading books. Sometimes I think I should only read a few books per year, studying them in depth. However, I've found that what works better for me, given my personality and such is to read lots of books and wait to see which of those continue to haunt me, so to speak, in the coming weeks and months.
I will find that I will listen to an audio book or read something that I will start to quote or recommend to others. This will be the most reliable sign that it is a book worth reviewing and re-reading. The quickest way to get through this process, then, is to read and listen to as many books as I can so that I can find out which of them I will really find useful.
Not sure if that method would work for everyone, but it certainly has seemed to work for me.

## Analysis

One of the books that I have been "reading" for over a year is Adler and Van Doren's Classic _How to Read A Book_. In it, the framework for "analytical reading" is laid out in the following four stages which I am trying to adopt:

1. "What is the book about as a whole?" (Subject/Classification)
2. "What is being said in detail, and how?" (Terms/Interpretation)
3. "Is the book true, in whole or part?" (Truth/Evaluation)
4. "What of it?" (Significance/Response)
