## Title: Minimalism
## Author: The Minimalists

- "It is not things that disturb us, but our interpretation of their significance" - Epictetus
- Introduction
    - Conformity and "keeping up" lead to stress
    - Mimimalism is their prescription for living a meaningful life
    - Encouraged to read the book more than once, take notes, and take action
- Seven chapters
- Arrival: their story
    - "The material possessions that we accumulate will not make us happy"
    - Dissatisfaction with material possessions (and the unhapiness that comes with that) is a "slow burn".
    - They identified their "anchors": the things that were preventing them from growing and making them feel stuck
    - Our memories are within *us*, not our things

- Five values that allowed them to live a meaningful life:
    1. Health
        - Health is not a destination
        - Unhealthy equals depression
        - Two main ingredients in being healthy: eating and exercising (what we put into, and what we do with our bodies)
        - "feeling better" is the metric of health
        - Avoid sugar and processed food 
        - Reduce gluten, non-water drinks, dairy, meat
        - Drink half your body weight in ounces of water per day
        - Intermittent fasting has great results: don't eat for 16 hrs per day, then two meals within 8 hours
        - Make sure that you enjoy exercise
        - Build variety into your excercise routine
        - Easy, quick exercises: push ups, pull ups, squats
        - Sleep is paramount
        - Change "shoulds" into "musts". Make health mandatory in your life.
    2. Relationships
        - We can't continually focus on past relationships. It's like driving while only looking in the rearview mirror.
        - Three ways to change your relationships:
            1. Find new relationships
            2. Transform current relationships
            3. Change yourself
        - Make a three column list of very relationship: name, closeness, and effect. Don't focus on those that are negative or matter least to you.
        - You can't change others. Only yourself.
        - Being the best you in contagious. It brings out the best in others.
        - Relationships should always be growing. Work towards that.
        - Every great relationship is founded on: love, trust, honesty, caring, support, attention, authenticity, understanding
        - Honesty is an engine of simplicity. If we plan on telling the truth always, there is nothing to prepare for.
        - Authentic people have no agenda, but have aspirations.
        - Formula for understanding someone else: T.A.R.A: Tolerate, accept, respect, appreciate. Basically, empathy.
        - Relationships require nourishment.
    3. Passions
        - Your life will not feel fulfilled if you lack passion. (71)
        - What we call our work is telling: "job", "career", "mission" (72)
        - "What we do" (as a career) typically pigeon holes us as a certain kind of person to others. A better question is "What are you passionate about?" (74)
        - There aren't necessarily "passionate people". You choose to be passionate, and some days are tough for everybody. (77)
        - Passion begets passion (78)
        - Anchoring your identity to your vocation is a common pitfall. (79)
        - You need to have a written, monthly budget (85)
            - Categorize as "need", "want", "like"
            - Give every dollar a destination
            - Everyone in the household should have a say in the budget
            - Scrutinize the monthly budget daily, weekly, monthly as needed. Adjust as you go.
            - Have a safety net that has a starting amount of $500-1000
            - Make sure to "pay your future self" by investing your money
            - Get debt free. There is no such thing as true "good debt"
            - Minimize expenditures, possessions, etc.
            - Contribute to others and good causes
        - Someone is earning a living doing what you are passionate about. Go out and model that person to find out how to do it too. (92)
        - Find at least three people doing the thing that you are passionate about and meet them. Buy them coffee, add value in some way.
    4. Growth
        - If you're not growing, you're dying. (96)
        - Growth happens one of two ways: Giant leaps or baby steps. Typically the baby steps are where real change happens. (96)
        - Leverage is the ability to associate enough satisfaction with a change that it makes it so that you "must" change (97)
        - Taking action requires the first step and building momentum (98)
        - Push yourself and your standards beyond your comfort zone (99)
        - Growth is slow, but consistent. Get better every day. (100)
    5. Contribution
        - As you grow, you'll find that you have more of yourself to give. (101)
        - Always ask, "how does this task add value to who I'm trying to help?" (103)
        - There are two typees of positive experiences. Those that you enjoy and thoses that you do not. Transforming the first into the second is the key to a meaningful life (107)
        - Find ways to make negative-feeling, but positive experiences. Be silly and make it a game. (110)

- Confluence
    - Everyone typically has two values that they gravitate towards the most. (113)
    - "Minimalism is a tool to eliminate life's excess and focus on the essentials." (117)
    - Combine activities that impact more than one of the values. For instance, work out with the person that you love (119)
    - Their success formula: Hapiness + constant improvement = success (120)

## Analysis
1. "What is the book about as a whole?"
    - The book deals with the modern philosohpy of "Minimalism" as put forth by the authors.
2. "What is being said in detail, and how?"
    - The book breaks down the objective of minimalism into five values: health, relationships, passions, growth, and contribution.
    - It gives examples and guidelines of how to live out the philosophy through the positive decisions made in the context of the five values.
3. "Is the book true, in whole or part?"
    - The book's thesis that "The material possessions that we accumulate will not make us happy" is absolutely true if taken to mean that existentially, that whatever happiness they do bring us is fleeting.
    - The book does a great job of defining all of the things that will not give us a meaningful life and should be "minimized". However, it falls short in its relativistic assertion that we can all define meaning for ourselves.
4. "What of it?"
    - The practical exhortations and examples are useful in tearing away the many "anchors" of a consumerist worldview, and should be followed.
    - As a Christian, true meaning comes from living a life that honors God, and I believe that all of the admonishments are useful in detaching oneself from the "lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life."
